Developed a Python-based web application to provide tailored vacation recommendations for top European destinations and capital cities, optimizing for both ideal weather conditions and budget-friendly accommodations. The hotel quality is determined by real-time prices and hotel ratings retrieved from booking.com.
Integrated data from a weather API to assess and rank cities based on favorable weather conditions during the specified travel period.
Retrieved up-to-date hotel information from booking.com for each user request to identify and rank the most cost-effective lodging options.
Implemented a Flask API to serve the Python application, powering a web interface.
